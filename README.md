# INIT
Information Interchange using Text

INIT is a human-readable data serialisation and exchange format. 

Sample file:

~~~
Animal = tortoise
Age = 34

[Profile]
Favourite-food = baby leaf
Usual-carer := Amanda

[Amanda]
Name = Amanda Wall
Employee-id = 351
~~~

## Motivation 

Does the world need one more data interchange format?

No it doesn't.
